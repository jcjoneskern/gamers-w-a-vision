      <p>If you want to save lives by helping with a tournament, there are many things you can do. In addition to playing in the tournament, you can bring gear to use, distribute flyers, post on social media, help with concessions, or serve on an organization committee for a future tournament. To see how you can help, please send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@gamerswithavision.org?Subject=I%27d%20like%20to%20help" target="_top">contact@gamerswithavision.org</a></p>
      <p>We would love to see Gamers With A Vision chapters spring up everywhere video games are played. If you are interested in forming a chapter in your area, please send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@gamerswithavision.org?Subject=I%27d%20like%20to%20start%20a%20chapter" target="_top">contact@gamerswithavision.org</a></p>
