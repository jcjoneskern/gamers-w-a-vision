      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Gamers With A Vision was created by a group of college students in Akron, Ohio in early 2017. They were inspired by something written by Richard Stearns, President of the humanitarian organization World Vision:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "I want you to imagine for a moment that you woke up this morning to the following headline: ONE HUNDRED JETLINERS CRASH, KILLING 18,000. Think of the pandemonium this would create across the world as heads of state, parliaments, and congresses convened to grapple with the nature and causes of this tragedy. Think about the avalanche of media coverage it would ignite around the globe as reporters shared the shocking news and tried to communicate its implications for the world... Now imagine that the very next day, one hundred more planes crashed&mdash;and one hundred more the next, and the next, and the next. It is unimaginable that something that terrible could ever happen.

        But it did&mdash;and it does. It happened today, and it happened yesterday. It will happen again tomorrow. But there was no media coverage. No heads of state, parliaments, or congresses stopped what they were doing to address the crisis, and no investigations were launched. Yet around 18,000 children died yesterday of preventable causes related to their poverty, and it will happen again today and tomorrow and the day after that."
      </blockquote>
      <p>Unlike past generations, this generation cannot plead ignorance of dire conditions around the world, nor can we claim there is no way to save the lives of the people across the globe who die from preventable causes every year. Things as simple as mosquito nets and access to clean water can literally mean the difference between life and death for millions of people. The only thing lacking is the will of people to do something about it.</p>
      <p>These college students had the will. They also liked to play video games&mdash;a lot. Putting these two passions together, they came up with the idea of hosting charity video game tournaments to raise money to help the people in direst need around the world.</p>
      <p>Do you have the will? Do you like to play video games&mdash;a lot? You sound like our kind of people. Join us!</p>
